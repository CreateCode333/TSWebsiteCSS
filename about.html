            <h2>A Little Bit About Me...</h2>
        <p>
        I  studied Oceanography at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, where I learned a lot about the ocean, and developed extensive research and writing skills.<br><br>

        I fell into graphic design while working at an aquarium. I found that, while taking care of animals is a fine career, my calling is connected to communicating messages about the natural world through creative means. Using illustrations, photographs, and captivating content, I create signage and exhibits to educate people about marine animals and their habitats. The end goal is to create a sense of wonder which inspires people to take responsibility and care more about the Earth.<br><br>

        I learned my graphic design skills on-the-job. Using Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and  Illustrator, I began by creating posters, brochures, and newsletters. As my position and skills evolved, I became more involved in designing exhibits and writing interpretive signage for exhibits.<br><br>
            
        In 2022, coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, my husband and I reprioritized our lives and decided to do things we have always wanted to do before we got too old to do them. We moved to Idaho to be closer to family, buy a house, and do more of the outdoor things that we love to do – like skiing. <br><br>
        As a lifelong learner, I decided that it was time to try a new skill, so I signed up for a coding bootcamp through Idaho State University in the spring of 2024. It’s going to be challengin, but I also believe that it will be very rewarding. I’m excited for this new chapter of my life!<br><br>

            <h2>Examples of My Work</h2>
            <p>My oceangraphy degree brought me to the Oregon Coast Aquarium, where I worked for 21 years! I designed signage and exhibits. My preferred software programs for these tasks were the Adobe Creative Suite of products including Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I used these products to write the interpretive signage and design educational and innovative exhibits. <br><br>
